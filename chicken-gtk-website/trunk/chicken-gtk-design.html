<div align="center"><h1>Design of Another Chicken Gtk</h1></div>
<p>The binding is composed of two parts. The first is a swig wrapper arround the "C" functions. The second is a "Object" wrapper arround the actual gobjects themselves. The goal here is to basically make gtk for scheme what pygtk is for python. If you are after just a basic "C" wrapper then probably you should look at the "real" chicken gtk. It is probably useful to have an understanding of how the promethus object system works. Look at the <A href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/prometheus-manual.html">manual</A>.</p>
<p>
As stated in the glib manual, all objects/classes inherit off the gobject in glib. GObject handles much of the nitty gritty such as signal-connection/disconnection, object construction, properties etc. All objects in chicken-gtk inherit either directly or indirectly off GObject. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt style="font : bold medium serif;">Description of GObject in chicken-gtk</dt>
<dt>'this</dt>
<dd>value slot which contains the underlying swig ptr object</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each object/class is contained in its own generated file in the scm directory. For example the class describing GtkButton is contained in the file "GtkButton.scm". The reason why each class description is in its own file is because of organization, and more importantly if the files are too large the chicken compiler has problems compiling it. The insides of the GtkButton.scm looks something like this</p>
<pre>
(declare (unit GtkButton))
(define GtkButton (GtkBin 'clone))

(GtkButton 'add-method-slot! 'pressed 'pressed!
         (lambda (self resend )
           (gtk-button-pressed (self 'this) )
           ))

(GtkButton 'add-method-slot! 'released 'released!
         (lambda (self resend )
           (gtk-button-released (self 'this) )
           ))

........ omited for brevity

(GtkButton 'add-method-slot! 'new 'new! (lambda (self resend . args)
                             (self 'set-this! (chicken-g-object-newv (gtk-button-get-type) args))))

</pre>
<p>Looking at the api docs for <A href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkButton.html">GtkButton</A>. We see that the method 'pressed maps to gtk_button_pressed. The value slot 'this always maps to the "Swig C Pointer" of the GLib/Gtk object. Also note each method slot has 2 methods, the second one is used to set for custom methods. The "override" is done in "chicken-gtk.scm".</p>
<div align="center"><h2>How the code is generated</h2></div>
<p>The defs files from the pygtk project are parsed into a "tree". This is in the codegen directory. The defs are in the defs directory. All objects inherit off gobject. All objects constructors are made with the method 'new. Then the object-methods are created, which then map to the actual "C" api calls.</p>
